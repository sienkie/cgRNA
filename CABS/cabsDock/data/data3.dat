version,1.0,,,,
description,"CABSdock application is a versatile tool for molecular docking of peptides to proteins.
It allows for flexible docking (also with large-scale conformational changes) and with-
out knowledge about the binding site. CABSdock enables peptide docking using only in-
formation about the peptide sequence and the protein receptor structure. In addition to
this input data, many advanced options are available that allow for manipulation of a
simulation setup, a degree of protein flexibility or guiding the peptide binding etc.

CABSdock method has been first made available as a web server [Nucleic Acids Research,
43(W1): W419-W424, 2015; web server website: http://biocomp.chem.uw.edu.pl/CABSdock].
The standalone application version [submitted to publication] provides the same mo-
deling methodology equipped with many additional features and customizable options.",,,,

and the protein receptor structure. In addition to peptide sequence, a peptide secondary structure
information may be provided.",,,
"-r, --receptor",RECEPTOR,"Loads receptor structure.

RECEPTOR can be either:

1. PDB code (optionally with chain IDs)
i.e. '-r 1CE1:HL' loads chains H and L of 1CE1 receptor structure downloaded from the PDB database

2. PDB file (optionally gzipped)",,,
"-p, --peptide",PEPTIDE,"Loads peptide sequence and optionally peptide secondary structure in one-letter code (can be used multiple times to add multiple peptides).

PEPTIDE can be either:

1. amino acid sequence in one-letter code
(optionally annotated with secondary structure: H - helix, E - sheet, C - coil) 
i.e. '-p HKILHRLLQD:CHHHHHHHHC' loads HKILHRLLQD peptide sequence
with the secondary structure assignemnt: CHHHHHHHHC

HINT: If possible, it is always recommended to use secondary structure information/prediction.
For residues with ambiguous secondary structure prediction assignment it is better to assign
coil (C) than the regular (H - helix or E - extended) type of structure.

2. PDB code (optionally with chain ID) 
i.e. '-p 1CE1:P' loads the sequence of the chain P from 1CE1 receptor

3. PDB file with peptide's coordinates, loads only a peptide sequence from a PDB file",,append,

#group,RECEPTOR OPTIONS,"Receptor options allows to exclude some receptor residues from docking search and to manipulate the
degree of protein receptor flexibility (using either --receptor-flexibility or --receptor-restraints)",,,
"-e, --exclude",RESIDUES,"Excludes receptor residues listed in RESIDUES from the docking search, therefore enforces more
effective search in other areas of a receptor surface, for example, it may be known that some
parts of the protein are not accessible to peptide (due to binding to other proteins) and
therefore it could be useful to exclude these regions from the search procedure

RESIDUES must be a single string of characters (no whitespaces) consisting of residue identifiers
(i. e. 123:A) or chain identifiers (i. e. A) joined with the '+' sign. '-' is also allowed to
specify a continous range of residues, or chains.

Examples:
'-e 123:A'                     excludes residue 123 from chain A
'-e 123:A+125:A'                        residues 123 and 125 from chain A
'-e 123:A-125:A'                        residues 123, 124 and 125 from chain A
'-e A'                                  whole chain A
'-e A+C'                                chains A and C
'-e A-C'                                chains A, B and C

"-f, --receptor-flexibility",FLEXIBILITY,"Modifies flexibility of selected receptor's residues:

0 - fully flexible backbone
1 - almost stiff backbone (default value, given appropriate number of receptor restraints,
    see --receptor-restraints option, value 1 allows for )
> 1 - increasing stiffnes

FLEXIBILITY can be either:

1. positive real number
all receptor residues are assigned the same flexiblity equal that number

2. 'bf'
flexibility for each residue is read from the beta factor column of the CA atom in the pdb input file
(Note that standard beta factor in pdb file has opposite meaning to CABSdock flexibillity, edit pdb
accordingly or use FLEXIBILITY = 'bfi'),

3. 'bfi'
flexibility is assigned from the inverted beta factors in the input pdb file so that
bf = 0.0 -> f = 1.0 and bf >= 1.0 -> f = 0.0

4. <filename>
flexibility is read from file <filename> in the format of single residue entries:

resid_ID <flexibility> i.e. 12:A 0.75
 
or residue ranges:

resid_ID - resid_ID <flexibility> i.e. 12:A - 15:A  0.75

multiple entries can be used",1.0,,
"-R, --receptor-restraints",MODE GAP MIN MAX,"Allows to generate a set of binary distance restraints for C-alpha atoms, that keep the receptor
in predefined conformation.

MODE can be either:

1. 'all' - generate restraints for all receptor residues
2. 'ss1' - generate restraints only when at least one restrained residue is assigned regular secondary
           structure (helix or sheet)
3. 'ss2' - generate restraints only when both restrained residues are assigned regular secondary
           structure (helix, sheet)

GAP specifies gap along the main chain for two resiudes to be restrained
MIN and MAX are min and max values in Angstroms for two residues to be restrained",all 5 5.0 15.0,,

conformations and locations (when these additional options are not used, starting peptide conformations

PEPTIDE must be either:

1. amino acid sequence in one-letter code (optionally annotated with secondary structure:
H - helix, E - sheet, C - coil)

2. pdb file (may be gzipped)

3. pdb code (optionally with chain_id i.e. 1abc:D)

CONFORMATION sets initial conformation of the peptide. Must be either:

1. random - random conformation is provided [default]

2. keep - preserve conformation from file. This has no effect if PEPTIDE=SEQUENCE.
    
LOCATION sets initial location for the peptide. Must be either:

1. random - peptide is placed in a random location on the surface of a sphere centered at the
receptor's geometrical center at distance defined by the '-s, --separation' option from the surface
of the receptor.

2. keep - preserve location from file. This has no effect if PEPTIDE=SEQUENCE

3. patch - list of receptor's residues (i.e 123:A+125:A+17:B) Peptide will be placed above the
geometrical center of listed residues at distance defined by the '-s, --separation' option from the
surface of the receptor. WARNING: residues listed in path should be on the surface of the receptor and

model).",,,
--ca-rest-add,RESI RESJ DIST WEIGHT,"Add distance restraint between CA atom in residue RESI and CA atom in residue RESJ

DIST is a distance between these atoms and WEIGHT is restraint's weight from [0, 1].

In order to add restraints between the peptide and the receptor, or between two peptides
use PEP1, PEP2, ... as chain identifiers of the peptides (even when peptide is read from a pdb file
its chain identifier is ignored).

i.e. ""123:A 5:PEP1 8.7 1.0"" adds restraint between the CA atom of the residue '123' in the chain A of
the receptor and the CA atom of the 5th residue of the peptide.

If you add only one peptide both 'PEP' and 'PEP1' is a valid chain identifier.

If you add multiple peptides they will be ordered as follows: [1] from config file added by the
'peptide' option [2] from config file added by the 'add-peptide' option [3] from command line added by
the '-p, --peptide' option [4] from command line added by the '--add-peptide' option.

Peptides added by the same method preserve the order by which they appear in the config file, or on the
command line.
